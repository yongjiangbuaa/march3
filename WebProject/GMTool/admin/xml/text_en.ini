The comics have been translated into over 110 languages and have sold over 350 million copies worldwide. \nThe story is centered around a small Gaulish village, on the coast of modern day Brittany, a province in Gaul (now France). By 50 BC, Julius Caesar has conquered all of Gaul except for this small enclave, vexing him to no end. Surrounded on all sides by the sea and 4 unlucky Roman garrisons, the villagers are able to resist repeated attempts by the Romans to invade them due to a magic potion brewed by the village druid, Getafix. Asterix, the eponymous hero, is a rather short but fearless warrior known for his cunning and down-to -earth attitude. He is often entrusted with missions on behalf of the villagers and village chief, Vitalstatistix. He goes on the quests armed with the potion that bestows superhuman strength and is almost always accompanied by his closest friend, Obelix. Obelix is a simple-minded menhir sculptor well known for being “big boned” but prefers to refer to himself as well covered or whose chest has “slipped a bit”. Obelix fell into the magic potion during his childhood so he is no longer allowed to drink it, much to his dismay. In one of the stories, the two of them adopt a small dog called Dogmatix.  This smart, nature-loving creature has a short temper and absolutely no sense of direction when it comes to sniffing out a trail. He is usually seen tagging along on the pair's adventures, adding to the mischief and helping them in some situations.\nMy Lord, help the trio collect magic potion to keep their village safe. You can collect 1 to 3 magic potions by attacking Monsters in the Kingdom map. Use the magic potions and receive rewards in exchange.

150199=Halloween  is approaching! This festival originates from the Celtic New Years celebration.  2000 years ago, the Celts lived in modern-day Ireland,  England and Northern France. The 1st of November was their New Year. On  the eve, which is the 31st of October, besides celebrating the arrival of a new year, the Celts would also ask for blessings from their ancestors and good-hearted spirits by giving them food offerings.\nHalloween  celebrations used to be simple and were usually held in churches. As  time went on, however, the festival is now a fun-filled day in  which people scare one another and share ghost stories. On Halloween, people dress  up in different sorts of interesting, and sometimes even bizarre, costumes,  and the children go 'trick or treating' by going from house to house knocking on doors and demanding to be treated to candy.\nMy Lord, to celebrate this exciting festival, we have prepared a special in-game Halloween Event!

In Britain, this may be regarded as one of the most beautiful nights as great bonfires will be lit and fireworks set off throughout the evening.\nBonfire Night, also known as Guy Fawkes Night, is a traditional British holiday. It dates back to the 5th of November 1603, when a group of men, led by Guy Fawkes, secretly buried 36 barrels of gunpowder underneath the House of Lords in an attempt to assassinate James I and his Parliament. The plot was discovered when one of his collaborators reported him. Fawkes was arrested on the spot. He and his accomplices were later sentenced to death. To celebrate the failed assassination attempt, it was declared that bonfires and fireworks be used to observe this day. Every year British people gather together and burn an effigy of Guy Fawkes on a big bonfire to commemorate the failure of the gunpowder plot. \nDuring the Event, Lords can gather resources in the Kingdom Map (except at gold mines) to receive Pyrotechnics.

10024318=You bastards, where did you run? If i ever see you in my tree farm again, it wouldn’t end good for you!
10024319=Vecchi, is there any new good material for axe-head making? Mine is a bit rusty.
10024320=This axe-head, loved it from the first sight, I’ll take it, Vecchi, wrap it for me.
10024321=Before coming to these lands, great master of the royal city asked me to give this letter and these acceleration scrolls to the lord, please accept them, i have to go back to the royal city this afternoon.

10024332=Jon, I recently made a new iron axe, and I want you to fight with me, lets see if my new weapon can beat you.
10024333=Guys, come and take a look at this new axe, Old master says it’s a sharpest axe in the history.
10024334=What kind of broken weapon is it? It seems broken and blunt, you must have bought it in the east end of the city, they always sell rotten items.
10024335=Stop this robber, I dare you steal my items in my territory, I gonna break your legs once I catch you!
10024336=I can sweep any enemy with the sharpest axe in the history, but the thing is - no one wants to fight with me.
10024337=Hey Jon, where you’ve been these days? Been a long time since we fought last time. There is no any other opponents, only you can withstand me.
10024338=Oh this Jon, he said i was dragging his feet again, I will prove you that I am the best.
10024339=Buddy, take your hands off me, I hate when people touch my head.
10024340=You are making me mad, silly, don’t think I'm just a goblin, i can behead your head and use it as a ball.
10024341=Hi, we are the best casters in the city, everything we cast are superior weapons, ask around if there is anyone who doesn’t know us.
10024342=Best weapons in the whole city, come and grab one you like!  Make yourself more powerful!
10024343=Great explorers, don’t you need a weapon that fully satisfy your needs? Come to us to fulfill all your requirements.
10024344=Brother, there is new magician in the city, people say that she is not only pretty, but also very powerful.
10024345=Yeah, brother, i’ve seen that magician, she is very beautiful, I think I kinda fell for her.
10024346=That’s bad, robber showed up, damn, he stole my weapon again. It looks like a bad day…
10024347=Great Jon, without you our city is very weak and dangerous, that idiot Biru only knows to brag.
10024348=Jon, my Jon, finally here you are, please help us to punish this gang of robbers.
10024349=Jon, this hammer was specially forged for you, with this hummer, i hope you can bring the peace back to our city.
10024350=Thank you great Jon, city was brought to old peace days, we will remember your glorious moment.
10024351=Biru? This guy can only run around with the iron in his hands, i disdain to fight with you.
10024352=Oh god, i went traveling only for a short time, and city became in chaos so fast, it seems that busy days are coming. 
10024353=Robbers are becoming more and more savage theses days, we have to round up the whole gang.
10024354=Stupid Biru, is fighting the only thing in your head, robbers are getting savage, we have to beat them together.
10024355=Hey Biru, wake up, get your armer dressed, we are ready to go, or you want to drag us down again?
10024356=Forward! Brothers, pick up your weapons and beat the crap out of these robbers!
10024357=This battle, wasn’t easy for us, i want you guys to remember, that this is our moment of glory.
10024358=Not again… bunch of guys who overestimated their power. Want to see me destroying you one by one?
10024359=Biru, we just had a big fight, where were you? I didn’t see you killing any enemy on the battlefield, or all you can is just showing off?
10024360=OK, Biru, I will fight with you tonight and show what the real strength is, so won’t talk nonsense anymore.
10024361=My name is Tauriel and this is my castle, no one can beat me, cause I’m the King of War!
10024362=Friends, we can’t just sit and wait for death, enemy is getting aggressive, we gotta hang it there!
10024363=Enemies shellfire is bombing our troops, we have to take out our weapons and demonstrate them our power.
10024364=Tauriel,  enemies are coming from the left, lead your people and get rid of enemies.
